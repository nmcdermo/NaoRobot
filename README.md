This program allows the robot to walk forward and backwards, and to perform Tai Chi when given verbal commands

display.pml
This program recognizes objects stored in the Nao's database and reads them out loud.  For information on how to store objects in the Database please read my report.  It also contains unpolished processes that can recognize age, gender, and mood, and give you a name (a random float).  These are disabled by default.
